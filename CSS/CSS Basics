CSS Basics
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

These are used to add styles to the html page


We can add css to the html in three ways.

   	1. Inline
   	2. Internal
   	3. External

Based on the use case we can use the type of styling. Mostly prefer External, because It could improve readability and easy for debugging also.

Precidence Order:

Inline > Internal > External


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Block Elements: These are the elements that take full width of the screen
ex: div, headings, p.....

Inline Elements: These are the elements that take only content width
ex: span, input, label,a,


So, inorder to make display elements on the user requirement, we use display command.
display:block;
display:inline;

 Selectors

     1.Element Selectors 

     Styling is given for elements. It will add styling to 
     all the elements present in the file 


     2. Class and Ids


	If we add element selector styling,then whole below h1 tags will be applied
     But we want different styling for different tags.
    Thats when comes classes and ids 
    Best Practice : same class can be given to two tags,
    but give unique id for each tag
    .class
    #id

     3. Descendent Selectors
     This selector is used to add style by using heirarchy. 

     div ul li{
		    background-color: red;
		}

     4. Children Selectors

       In the below given case, if we use descendent selector to
	    style element, it will add to both divs here, which is not recommended.
	    So, to solve this we have Children Selectors
	    Children Selectors will only apply to the direct children only.

	    div>h1>span{
		    background: green;
		}

      Difference between descendent and Children

 Parent |                         Parent
