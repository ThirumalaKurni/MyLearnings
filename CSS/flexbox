flexbox



display:flex    
tells that we are going to use flexbox properties, and to embed all the flexbox properties.
Basically used on top of all the containers.

There will two axis : main axis, cross axis.



By defaultly::::::::::
										|
										|
										|
										|
										|
										|
					--------------------|-----------------------Main Axis
										|
										|
										|
										|
										|
										|Cross Axis


This is important because, some properties like justify-content will work only on main axis, and align-content works on cross axis only..............

To reverse the direction of the axis::::::::::::::::
we use :

flex-direction: column;

this is will change the axis......



Now to put the content in the center/end/ or anyway.....we use
justify-content:center;

And
align-content:center;
works on cross axis to center the content.......


flex-wrap: wrap 
if the elements grow out of the flexbox,then this property will tell to wrap down the boxes.

Here the size of the box remains......

flex-basis,flex-grow,flex-shrink

flex-basis- will tell base width of the flex box
flex-grow- will tell at which rate the box should grow
flex-shrink- will tell at which rate it should shrink

Here size of the box changes automatically...........
