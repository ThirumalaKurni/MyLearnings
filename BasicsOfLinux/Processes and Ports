Processes and Ports

Process : Simply an instance of a program is a process. It is used to manage the execution of a program.

A program can have multiple instances of processes, and each of them are unique, and are differentiated by process Ids.

There are two types of processes:
1- foreground Processes : happens on the screen
2  Background Processes : happens on the backGround of the applications. for ex( In ms-word, we have spell correction,which happens background.)

 Commands :

1. top : It is used to display all the process running at the moment in real time.

PID - process Ids
USER - users running the process
PR   - Priority (-20 to 20)
NI   - Nice value
VIRT - Virtual Memory Used
RES  - Physical Memory Used
SHR - Shared Memory Used
S - Status of the process 
There are five types of processes:

1. D - uninterruptable Sleep
2. R - Running
3. S - Sleeping 
4. T - Traced or Stopped
5. Z - Zombie



PS Utility:

ps - to give status of processes running for a user
ps ux - to give all processes
pidof - used to get all the pids associated with the app/program.
for ex: pidof firefox

kill PID- used to terminate the process
for ex: kill 6204

 Niceness value : It is used to tell the os about the priority of the process.
  ranges from -20 to 19 : lower the nicesness higher the priority

  	-20 more Priority
  	19  Less Priority

  	Default value of all processes is 0.

 To give niceness based on our need we use:

 nice -n value program
 nice -n 10 firefox

to give niceness value for already running process

renice nicevalue -p PID
renice -20 -p 6302


df -h -> gives free hard disk space availble on the system.
free -h -> gives free RAM space availble on the system.



top
and then n -> to print the required number of processes
and then M -> sort based on memory usage
and then P -> sort based on CPU usage




Ports are done in networking concepts part.......
